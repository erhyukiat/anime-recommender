    "Anime, derived from the word \"animation\", refers to hand-drawn and computer animations from Japan. Prior to streaming services, it was difficult to watch anime outside of Japan. Then came fansubbers, who would add English subtitles to anime episodes and share them through illegal streaming sites or peer to peer file sharing. While this created an avenue for existing anime fans to watch their favourite animes, it does not help bring in new fans, as non-fans/prospective fans will only be exposed to anime through word of mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix added anime in 2014. From Google trends, there was an increase in interest of \"anime\" thereafter. Having anime on Netflix gave accessiblity and visiblity of animes. There is another increase in interest that coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, likely explained by people staying safe at home and getting anime recommendations by Netflix. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Netflix's anime selections are limited to well-known titles like Demon Slayer/Kimetsu no Yaiba, Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin. The goal of this project is to develop a recommender system, hosted on a webapp, that recommends animes that are popular or have been rated highly on the anime database, Anilist. These animes may or may not be available in Netflix, the main goal here is to let people know what else is out there (as opposed to being limited to Netflix selections)."
